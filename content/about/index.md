# Why unintended fraud?

It's a fun name.

It encapsulates a concept I believe we are all guilty of from time to time, regardless of the subject, where we would take
a shortcut in order to accomplish (or get rid of) a task faster, instead of truly understand the concept behind it. The reasons
behind it could be many, from not having time, to being lazy, to thinking it'll take forever, etc. Many times it left you
with an uneasy feeling of "I know this works but I don't know why", possibly coupled with a touch of "I don't like the fact
that I don't take time to understand the thing, but I won't right now anyway".

It is my experience that a lot of the times, it takes two seconds to remedy it. Two seconds of works after 10 years of "should I do it or not".

I have the perfect example to illustrate it: dilution. I'm some age in high-school, in chemistry class. We learn about dilution,
I master the related formulas, I ace every test, I blindly follow the instructions and even after a year or two of this,
I couldn't tell you what a dilution is. No idea, no clue, I just do the tasks like an AI to get the grades, but my brain is off the entire
time.

Until one day, we do some practice and I don't know if it's because of an eureka moment, or if it was the first time the word
dilution appeared right next to the question but it will probably forever be the most "THAT'S WHAT IT WAS" moment I ever had.
Just for the fact that it took me that long to really understand something so simple.

I think those moment happen a lot in software engineering, and hopefully this blog will make me write about stuff I want to
learn forcing me to go a bit deeper, and exposing holes if I find myself unable to write a post. Plus we all know from writing
cheat sheets that you retain the information just by doing it.
