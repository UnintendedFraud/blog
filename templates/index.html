        <h3>#about</h3>
        <p>
        Currently a full-stack software engineer using mostly Go and Typescript (React and Svelte).
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        My current goal is to improve my technical skills by going deeper on problems, possibly tinkering with non-web development. With that
        mindset I started learning Rust, tried some advent of code, some rustlings and following the book "Hands-on-Rust" which guide you 
        to create a videogame.
        <br>
        Overall trying to expose myself to lower-level / new areas of problems, we all know that "what can do more can do less" - someone
        smart (probably).

        Below are a few things I like, in a throwback of what old-school blog were before.
        Hopefully you'll find something you didn't know you would like!

        <h3>#what you should watch</h3>
        <p>Not the best movies I've seen ever, just a few that I've enjoyed recently.</p>

        <div class="movie">
             {% set image = resize_image(path="/static/movies/movie4.jpg", width=80, op="fit_width") %}
             <img src="{{ image.url }}" title="station eleven" />
             <div>
                <div class="movie-title">
                    <h4>Station Eleven</h4>
                    <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/station-eleven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">see on letterboxd</a>
                </div>
                <p><i>"A post apocalyptic saga spanning multiple timelines telling the stories of survivors of a devastating flu 
                    as they attempt to rebuild and reimagine the world anew while holding on to the best of whatâ€™s been lost."</i>
                <br>
                Despite what it sounds like, it has nothing to do with covid, it's from a book by Emily St. John Mandel - which I have
                not read -. The serie is very poetic, there are so many beautiful and emotionnal moments I cannot count them, it is 
                one of the best show I've seen in recent times. At the end I only wish I could erase my memory and watch it again.

        <div class="movie">

             <img src="{{ image.url }}" title="la passion de dodin bouffant" />

                    <h4>La Passion de Dodin Bouffant (The Taste of Things)</h4>

                <p>As a french and a food lover, I had to love this movie. Classy food porn is the best description one can make.</p>
             </div>
        </div>

        <div class="movie">
             {% set image = resize_image(path="/static/movies/movie2.jpg", width=80, op="fit_width") %}
             <img src="{{ image.url }}" title="miss sloane" />

                </div>
                <p>A battle between a genius lobbyist fighting for the people vs. the powerful gun lobby. A classic setup and overall
                a classic sequence of events. However the movie is extremely well made and well acted which makes it a must-see if you enjoy the
                genre. The ending is one of the most satisfying thing I've seen in a while even though you expect it to happen (which
                speak even more to the quality of the film I think).</p>
             </div>
        </div>

        <div class="movie">
             {% set image = resize_image(path="/static/movies/movie3.jpg", width=80, op="fit_width") %}
             <img src="{{ image.url }}" title="maestro" />
             <div>
                <div class="movie-title">
                    <h4>Maestro</h4>
                    <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/maestro-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">see on letterboxd</a>
                </div>
                <p>I watched Maestro during a sneak preview session (one of the best thing ever created). A movie clearly made for the oscars (long, black
                and white, main theme around what it takes to create amazing art, etc), it stays intense the entire time, both Bradley Cooper and
                Carey Mulligan are amazing. You'll be moved or you may be a robot.</p>

        <div class="movie">
             {% set image = resize_image(path="/static/movies/movie5.jpg", width=80, op="fit_width") %}
             <img src="{{ image.url }}" title="columbus" />
             <div>
                <div class="movie-title">
                    <h4>Columbus</h4>
                    <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/columbus-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">see on letterboxd</a>
                </div>
                <p>This is just the last quality movie of a genre I really loved for some reason, aka well directed, beautiful cinematography and 
                a very slow movie where not much happens. Just regular people living and talking. I don't know why but every time those movies
                make me feel so good and relaxed. If you're the same or if you're curious, Columbus is a sure bet.</p>

        <h3>#what you should read</h3>
        <p>Same as above with books although this is probably more what I last read as I read (way) less than I watch movies. (._.)</p>

        <div class="movie">
             {% set image = resize_image(path="/static/books/3body.jpg", width=80, op="fit_width") %}
             <img src="{{ image.url }}" title="three body problem" />
             <div>
                <div class="movie-title">
                    <h4>The Three-Body Problem Series (Liu Cixin)</h4>
                </div>
                <p>I saw this book recommended many times until I finally tried it. It took me a while to really get into it but
                after the mid-way mark of book one I was completely hooked. I couldn't stop reading. The book touches so many 
                different science-fiction concepts, theories, spanning across millions if not billions of years, it's like a guided
                meditation in your imagination and intellect. So many times the book ask a seemingly impossible question and explore how to solve it,
                it truly is fascinating. Plus the author managed to write the story in a way that makes you feel the full size and weight
                of the entire universe. Masterpiece.</p>
