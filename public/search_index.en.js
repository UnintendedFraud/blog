I can use them enough to work\nwithout any problems but every now and then, I take on an old branch or I ended up in a weird state and I am ashamed\nto report that I solve those by doing either:\n\n\ncopying some commands that seems good from the internet (while not spending any time learning how and why it works)\nasking a colleague and do the above\ngoing through the commands I think I know in loop until I'm in a good state\ngiving up and copying relevant files in a new branch, basically merging manually\n\nAn example I can give is the following (this is written from the point of view of not really understanding why):\nAt work more than once I ended up working on a pull request that ended up not being merged for a couple weeks, so could\nnot be merged before rebasing and fixing conflicts.\nBefore, I would not even rebase, I would merge master to branch, fix conflicts, push branch and merge the pull request.\nIn an attempt to do the right thing, recently I try rebasing and every time I would end up with all of the commits\nbetween the creation of the PR and the current state of master inside the PR. To see the mess visually, here is how it\nwould look in the github UI:\n[illustration]\nStep for messy branch\nWe have our PR and our branch. main has been updated since with 3 commits, creating conflicts. Added another commit\nto the branch after, to re-create the exact scenario.\nStarting the rebase (make sure your local main branch is up to date):\ngit rebase main\nConflits exist so the rebase stops:\nAuto-merging README.md\nCONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md\nerror: could not apply feacd65... bad take on the oscar\nhint: Resolve all conflicts manually, mark them as resolved with\nhint: \"git add/rm &lt;conflicted_files&gt;\", then run \"git rebase --continue\".\nhint: You can instead skip this commit: run \"git rebase --skip\".\nhint: To abort and get back to the state before \"git rebase\", run \"git rebase --abort\".\nCould not apply feacd65... bad take on the oscar\n\nFixing the conflict by keeping everything, then:\ngit add README.md\ngit rebase --continue\n\n[detached HEAD 237c721] after rebasing, adding and continuing\n 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)\nSuccessfully rebased and updated refs/heads/messy-branch.\n\nAfter writing the commit message, a git status gives me the following state:\nOn branch messy-branch\nYour branch and 'origin/messy-branch' have diverged,\nand have 5 and 2 different commits each, respectively.\n  (use \"git pull\" to merge the remote branch into yours)\n\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\n\nHere I'm happy with the state of the branch, so what I want to do is push and merge this back to main.\nHowever git push is denied, the following message shows:\n ! [rejected]        messy-branch -&gt; messy-branch (non-fast-forward)\nerror: failed to push some refs to 'github.com-unintendedfraud:UnintendedFraud/git-playground.git'\nhint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind\nhint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.\nhint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.\nhint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.\n\nLike a good boy, I follow the instructions, I git pull before git push again.\nHere two things can happen depending of how pull is configured in your git config, it will pull by doing either a\nmerge or a rebase.\n\n\npull doing a merge\nWe end up in a situation where we have to fix the same conflicts again, once fixed we commit and push. Done? Now we have\nduplicated all of the commits from main into messy-branch.\n[image messy-git history]\nDefinitely not what we want.\n\n\npull doing a rebase\n\n\nWhat should I have done?\nFirst, after the rebase when main and messy-branch diverged, instead of typing commands I should have step back and\nunderstand the state of the branch and commits.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/understanding-git/","title":"Understanding git better"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/about/":{"body":18,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/":{"body":0,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/second/":{"body":3,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/understanding-git/":{"body":401,"title":3}},"length":5},"lang":"English"};
